                It's easy to say you'll go home for Thanksgiving next year, or that you'll reschedule dinner with your
                dad, even though more often than not, you'll get busy and forget, going to do the other tasks that have
                deadlines or career repercussions, until he asks again.

                For the most part, we are able to spend this time how we like, but not all of it. Some of how we spend
                our time is predetermined, like how long we sleep. On average, a human being spends about a third of
                their life asleep. If we subtract this time, we have about <b>38 years left</b>.

This totals to 29 minutes a day. This accumulates to a little less than a year, leaving you with <b>24 years left</b>.

                So.
            </h3>
            <p>
                We know we haven't covered everything that people need to do to live. Things like exercising, grocery shopping, cooking, and laundry are largely inescapable parts of our lives too, but the point's probably pretty clear. We're looking at about 24 years of the remaining 57 years we have. This is the time we can spend however we want. 
            </p>
            <img src="24years.png" />
            <p>
                Here it is.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's so much you can do with these boxes... and yet they're inevitably exchanged for things that aren't super valueable. We're all too aware of the time we've spent bedrotting and doom scrolling. Some of us might even have apps on our phone telling us <i>exactly</i> how much time... But there's a decent chance you didn't really enjoy that time.
            </p>
            <p>
                We suggest that there are two possible ways to maximize the value of your time: either by spending it doing something that makes you happy, or by spending it doing something to make someone else happy.
